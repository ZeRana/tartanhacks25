# Setup
Make sure you have github desktop or the github cli signed in on your laptop. If you don't I can help you install it.
Linux or Mac:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZeRana/tartanhacks25.git
cd tartanhacks25
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # might not be responsive to that so do pip3 if it doesn't work
```

Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZeRana/tartanhacks25.git
cd tartanhacks25
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If we add more libraries rerun the last command to add those libraries to your virtual environment
